# Exchange Rate Forecasting using GRNN and LSTM

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project entitled:

"Exchange Rate Forecasting of Indonesian Rupiah against Yen, Yuan, and US Dollar using General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)."

## Objective
To forecast selling exchange rates using machine learning and neural network approaches and evaluate model performance.

## Dataset
- Exchange rate data (JPY, CNY, USD to IDR)
- Inflation data
- BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate

## Methods
- Data preprocessing
- Sequence data preparation
- General Regression Neural Network (GRNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## Evaluation
- RMSE
- MAPE
- Model comparison

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Notes
This project was developed for academic purposes and demonstrates applied machine learning for time series forecasting.
